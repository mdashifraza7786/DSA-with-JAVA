# Count nodes of linked list
Given a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

## Example 1:

- Input: 
    n = 4
    1->2->3->4
    Key = 3

- Output: True
- 3 is present in Linked List, so the function returns true.


## Expected Time Complexity : O(n)

## Expected Auxilliary Space : O(1)


## Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- 1 <= key  <= 10^5
